## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system-Django-PROJECT-.git](https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system-Django-PROJECT-.git)
cd student-management-system-Django-PROJECT-
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

- **For Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
- **For macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have Django installed (`pip install django`). Then, create a `requirements.txt` file which makes it easy for others to install the necessary packages.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now, you (or anyone else) can install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

This will create the database tables for your models.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser

This command creates an admin account to access the Django admin dashboard.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to create your username and password.

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The application will be available at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**.

---

## Usage 🧑‍🏫

1.  Start the development server.
2.  Navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/**.
3.  Log in with the superuser credentials you created.
4.  From the admin dashboard, you can start adding new **Streams**, **Subjects**, and **Students**.

## Screenshots 📸

*(This is a great place to add screenshots of your application's pages, like the student list, profile page, and admin dashboard. This makes your README much more impressive!)*
